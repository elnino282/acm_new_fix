/**
 * @deprecated This module has been moved to @widgets/layout
 * 
 * This file exists as a temporary adapter to prevent breaking existing imports.
 * All new code should import from '@/widgets/layout' or '@widgets/layout'.
 * 
 * Migration path:
 *   import { AppShell } from '@/features/shared/layout';
 *   ↓
 *   import { AppShell } from '@/widgets/layout';
 * 
 * This adapter will be removed once all imports have been migrated.
